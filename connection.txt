// Now if you do any changes in the file/folder then follow the follwing steps ...

2) [ git add . ]
3) [ git commit -m "msg" ]
4) [ git push origin main ]




// If a project folder was already initialized with git.After few days you again
// open it and want to do some changes in it. 
// Then no need to [git init] again as it has been already done before and git is 
// tracking the project.In that case just follow the steps mentioned above after changes.


// ** to check if any project is tracked by Git or not just do ---
//    open terminal -> [ls -a] :
//    if you see a file (.git), means git is initialized and it is tracked by git.
//    else git is not initialized and git not tracking the project. You need to
//    do [git init]
